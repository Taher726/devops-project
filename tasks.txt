I added:
- Auto-trigger build on Git push (GitHub Webhook): Instead of manually clicking Build Now, Jenkins can automatically start the pipeline whenever you push to GitHub.
- HTML / CSS validation using tidy package and csslint.

to do:
- Backup / rollback folder: keep the previous version and easily rollback.
- Deployment versioning
